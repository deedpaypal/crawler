SWIPE Top-Freezer Refrigerators (53) Top-freezers offer the most storage for their size and are the least expensive. Top-scoring refrigerators usually deliver more consistent temperatures. Recommended Top-Freezer Refrigerators Top-Freezer Refrigerators Ratings Bottom-Freezer Refrigerators (32) Bottom-freezers keep refrigerator items within easy reach. Most models we tested chill and freeze adequately and include pullout shelves or bins, split shelves, spill guards, and room in the door to hold a gallon of milk.  Recommended Bottom-Freezer Refrigerators Bottom-Freezer Refrigerators Ratings French-Door Refrigerators (189) Once you know how much space you have, particularly the width, our recommended models will help you find a refrigerator that fits in that space. Models that have higher energy-efficiency scores use less electricity for their capacity.  Recommended French-Door Refrigerators French-Door Refrigerators Ratings Side-by-Side Refrigerators (63) Side-by-sides are ideal for narrow kitchens but are the least space-efficient inside. Higher-end models offer half shelves. And if your household isn't large, remember that a smaller refrigerator is likely to use less electricity overall than a larger model.  Recommended Side-by-Side Refrigerators Side-by-Side Refrigerators Ratings Built-in Refrigerators (49) Built-ins align with cabinets. Most models we tested chill and freeze adequately and include pullout shelves or bins, spill guards, and room in the door for a gallon of milk. Top-scoring models usually deliver more consistent temperatures.  Recommended Built-in Refrigerators Built-in Refrigerators Ratings Compact Refrigerators (1) Several of the compact refrigerators did well at maintaining optimal temperatures in the fridge compartment. But as the scores show, most are poor choices for freezing. And even the most efficient of these small fridges use almost as much energy as full-sized models.  Recommended Compact Refrigerators Compact Refrigerators Ratings All Ratings Become a Member Join 6+ million members who believe that safety, fairness and honesty matter.

With custom panels, you can get a built-in that exactly matches your kitchen cabinets. And forget four doors—some newer models have five or more. You can even pull out a refrigerated drawer and find it full of frosty sodas.
