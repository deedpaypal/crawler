SWIPE All-in-One Printers (163) If there is a chance you might want to copy or scan, it's worth investigating an all-in-one printer. Although most models are bigger than the typical new stand-alone printer, they take up less space and cost less than a separate printer, scanner, and copier. Having to hook up only one device to your computer simplifies setup as well. An all-in-one's scanning function should be fine for print originals. The copying function is fine for casual use. Some all-in-ones add a fax function. As the ratings show, paying more for a printer doesn't necessarily mean you'll get better photos. And don't consider only the purchase price of the printer itself. Ink and maintenance costs can make a cheaper model more expensive in the long run than a higher-priced printer with lower ink costs. The two-year cost-of-ownership estimate is shown in the ratings. Recommended All-in-One Printers All-in-One Printers Ratings Regular Printers (60) Many of the regular inkjets available are bare-bones, low-cost models. Still, for the money, standard inkjets are solid all-purpose printers for most consumers who want to print both text and color photos. Most can print almost anything, including photos up to 8.5x11 inches or larger, text, and graphics such as greeting cards. You can use various types and sizes of paper, from business cards to banners. Don't print photos or color graphics? Traditional black-and-white laser printers can't be beat for fast text printing at a good cost, especially if you print reams of black-and-white text documents.

Become a Member Printers Buying Guide These days, many documents and photos live on laptop drives or on cloud services. But you still need a great printer to make your vacation snaps or quarterly reports into physical realities you can hang on a wall or hand out at a meeting. Printers have become less expensive and increasingly tricked-out over time. You can pick up a basic inkjet for well under $100.
