Get Started Best New Car Deals Save money on Consumer Reports' recommended cars By Todd Young and Jeff S.

Try again later A great price isn't necessarily a good deal if the vehicle doesn't measure up, so we help you choose a good car at a good price with monthly list of best new car deals. The featured vehicle highlighted below has an attractive incentive that can save you extra money, and it is recommended by Consumer Reports, as are all models detailed below. Other trims on the vehicles listed may also present good deals. Although incentives all eventually expire, they are often renewed. Even an expired deal can point you toward significant potential savings. Research ratings, reliability, owner satisfaction, and the latest dealer pricing on our car model pages. See our full list of this month's best new car deals below.   Spotlight Deal: 2019 Kia Optima Kia's midsized sedan packs a lot of substance and value. It drives nicely, with a firm yet absorbent ride and responsive, secure handling. The 2.4-liter four-cylinder is pleasant and returned 28 mpg overall in our tests; the uplevel 2.0-liter turbo-four packs more punch. The controls are very intuitive to use, but the low-mounted dash vents tend to blow more air on your hands. The 2019 freshened Optima comes standard with advanced safety features which include forward collision and rear cross-collision warning, lane keep assist, and blind spot warning.  Read our complete Kia Optima road test.
