SWIPE Point-and-Shoot Cameras (11) These are simple cameras, but some have optical zoom ranges as long as 23x. That's fine for shooting in your backyard, but not enough to capture action across a soccer field. Recommended Point-and-Shoot Cameras Point-and-Shoot Cameras Ratings Superzoom Cameras (20) If you go to a lot of baseball games or concerts, you may want a superzoom point-and-shoot camera. These models have optical zooms of at least 24x, and some are as long as 83x.  Recommended Superzoom Cameras Superzoom Cameras Ratings Advanced Point-and-Shoot Cameras (28) Like basic point-and-shoots, they have nondetachable lenses, but also have manual controls and other advanced features. They’re also more expensive than basic point-and-shoots. Recommended Advanced Point-and-Shoot Cameras Advanced Point-and-Shoot Cameras Ratings Waterproof & Rugged Cameras (9) If you want to shoot photos or video at the bottom of a swimming pool or beneath the waves, consider a waterproof point-and-shoot. Note that capabilities vary. Some claim to be waterproof to 50 feet, while others can be submerged to a fraction of that depth. Recommended Waterproof & Rugged Cameras Waterproof & Rugged Cameras Ratings Mirrorless Cameras (54) These models accept interchangeable lenses, like SLRs, but they're smaller and lighter. They don't have an SLR through-the-lens viewfinder. Recommended Mirrorless Cameras Mirrorless Cameras Ratings SLR Cameras (41) SLRs are interchangeable-lens cameras. Most are compatible with a number of lenses. With the most features, they're also the biggest and heaviest.
