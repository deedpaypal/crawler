SWIPE Drip Coffee Makers (120) With automatic-drip machines, the most popular type, you fill a chamber with water, load coffee into a filter basket, and flip a switch to heat the water and run it through the grounds and typically into the pot. Recommended Drip Coffee Makers Drip Coffee Makers Ratings Single-Serve Coffee Makers (48) These force water through a small packet, either a hard-shelled capsule or a soft pod resembling a tea bag. Some accept an adapter that takes your favorite loose grounds. Recommended Single-Serve Coffee Makers Single-Serve Coffee Makers Ratings Specialty Coffee Makers (2) These machines brew differently from the standard drip method. Some mimic traditional French presses, suspending the coffee grounds in hot water for a period of time before filtering. Recommended Specialty Coffee Makers Specialty Coffee Makers Ratings Espresso Makers (1) Our espresso maker ratings include scores for taste, frothing ability, weight, and convenience. We evaluate convenience by looking at what is involved to set up and brew a cup of espresso, the noise and vibration of the espresso maker, how easy it is to clean, and more.

The most basic coffee makers make at least a decent cup, but a little more money buys conveniences such as programmability, a thermal carafe to keep coffee hot longer, settings that let you adjust brew strength, and more.
