SWIPE Front-Load Washing Machines (42) The best front-loaders clean better and are gentler than the best HE top-loading washing machines while using less water. Front-loaders take longer than HE top-loaders but spin faster, extracting more water and reducing dryer time. Recommended Front-Load Washing Machines Front-Load Washing Machines Ratings Top-Load Agitator Washing Machines (27) Agitator models cost less and are faster than top-loading washing machines without an agitator, known as HE washing machines. Recommended Top-Load Agitator Washing Machines Top-Load Agitator Washing Machines Ratings Top-Load HE Washing Machines (41) Capacities keep increasing in HE washers, so you can do more laundry at once. HE top-loaders use less water and extract more of it from laundry than agitator top-loaders. This cuts dryer time, saving energy and money. Recommended Top-Load HE Washing Machines Top-Load HE Washing Machines Ratings Compact Washing Machines (18) Smaller spaces demand smaller appliances, and compact washer-and-dryer sets are slowly growing in popularity. In recent years some stackable laundry appliances have become more stylish and have larger door openings for easier access. Recommended Compact Washing Machines Compact Washing Machines Ratings Washer/Dryer Pairs Matching washer and dryer pairs are a widely sold choice, although some don't make a great couple.
