SWIPE Electric Smoothtop Ranges (49) Our recommended ranges can do it all and, based on our survey of thousands of readers, do not have brand reliability problems. CR Best Buys are recommended ranges that combine impressive performance and value. Recommended Electric Smoothtop Ranges Electric Smoothtop Ranges Ratings Electric Induction Ranges (6) Recommended ranges will bring pasta water to a fast boil, hold a big batch of spaghetti sauce or chili at a low simmer, and deliver dozens of cookies that are evenly baked and nicely browned.  Recommended Electric Induction Ranges Electric Induction Ranges Ratings Electric Coil Ranges (2) Broiling is impressive or better on recommended ranges, and the oven is large and self-cleaning and scored Good or better. CR Best Buys are recommended ranges that combine impressive performance and value.  Electric Coil Ranges Ratings Gas Ranges (67) Our recommended gas and dual-fuel ranges (which pair a gas cooktop and an electric oven) are top-scoring and, based on our survey of thousands of readers, do not have brand reliability problems. Recommended Gas Ranges Gas Ranges Ratings Pro-Style Ranges (30) Pro-style ranges make a statement. But despite their high price, they aren't the best ranges we've tested. We cover both gas and dual-fuel ranges, which pair a gas cooktop and an electric oven. Some pro-style ranges have surprisingly small ovens and lack a self-clean feature.

Become a Member Ranges Buying Guide The range is the workhorse of the kitchen, and if it's stylish, then it's probably the centerpiece, too. The choice between gas and electric ranges is largely dictated by what you have. Gas ranges require you to have either natural gas or propane service at your home, while an electric range will work in any house, provided you have a 220-volt electric line, and outlet, in your kitchen. An electrician can easily install one if you don't.  If you're replacing an existing range, buying a new model of the same type and size ensures the new range will fit, and function, as your old model did. If you plan to switch from gas to electric, or vice versa, you'll likely need an electrician or plumber to run new lines. Same goes for upgrading to a dual-fuel pro-style range, which partners gas burners with an electric oven, and requires both the standard gas and electrical connections.  If you're replacing an older radiant electric range, consider an induction range. These appliances run on the same standard electric line as a regular electric range, but their burners use electromagnetic pulses to transfer energy directly to your cookware, causing pots and pans—but not burners—to get hot. The ovens in induction ranges work just like those in regular electric ranges. Induction ranges cost a little more than radiant electric ranges, but they tend to boil water faster and simmer more steadily, and as a group, induction ranges outperform all the other types of ranges in our ratings.  Read More Range Buying Guide How to Deep-Clean a Kitchen Range Italian Pro-Style Ranges: Stainless Steals?
