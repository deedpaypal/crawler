CR Expert Advice What You Need to Know About Buying a New Car Don't Be Influenced By Ads Create your list of cars to test drive based on research, focusing on reliable cars, with high owner satisfaction, good safety marks, and strong road test performance. Don't Scrimp on Safety Advanced safety features can help avoid an accident or lessen the impact of a crash. They are becoming widely available, though they are still not standard on many models and trims. No Thanks to Extras Car dealers generally make most of their profit from financing and the sale of a wide variety of extra add-on products like theft protection, asset protection, prepaid maintenance, tire and key replacement plans, VIN etching, and extended warranties. Pass on Special Events Don't shop during special sales events solicited by direct mail. These are often run by contracted specialists trained in techniques that increase a dealer's profit. Smart Financing Resist the temptation to focus strictly on monthly payments to consider the long-term impact of your finance strategy, considering loan rate, interest paid, trade in, and even depreciation. Fees to Avoid If you see additional "pre-delivery inspection," "delivery," "destination," or "dealer prep" charges on a second window sticker, you should refuse to pay them.

The Consumer Reports Build & Buy Car Buying Service (the "Service") is provided to Consumer Reports users by TrueCar.com. TrueCar operates the Service's dealer network and the Service's website. Consumer Reports collects a fee from TrueCar for vehicles purchased from a TrueCar dealer. 100% of the fees we collect goes to support our nonprofit mission. Consumer Reports has no financial relationship with any dealer. Neither Consumers Reports nor TrueCar brokers, sells, or leases motor vehicles. Each TrueCar Certified Dealer will confirm actual vehicle availability from in-stock inventory, including options and color choices. The Service may not be available in your particular location. * Between 7/1/17 and 9/30/17, the average savings off MSRP presented by Participating Dealers to users of the Build & Buy Car Buying Service, based on users who configured virtual vehicles and who TrueCar identified as purchasing a new vehicle of the same make and model listed on the certificate from a Participating Dealer as of 10/31/2017, was $3,101, including applicable vehicle specific manufacturer discounts. Your actual savings may vary based on multiple factors including the vehicle you select, region, dealer, and applicable vehicle specific manufacturer incentives which are subject to change. The MSRP is determined by the manufacturer, and may not reflect the price at which vehicles are generally sold in the dealer's trade area as not all vehicles are sold at MSRP. Each dealer sets its own pricing. Neither TrueCar nor Consumer Reports brokers, sells or leases motor vehicles. Member Support Contact Us Account Settings What is Membership?
